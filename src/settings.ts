            question: "What services does Vandelay Technologies offer for Web3 startups and token launches?",
            answer: "Vandelay Technologies provides full-stack Web3 development and advisory services, including smart contract creation, token launches (ERC-20, NFT, and beyond), dApp architecture, community building, and infrastructure scaling. Whether you're launching a memecoin, DeFi protocol, NFT collection, or social dApp, we help crypto-native teams bring ideas to life with battle-tested tools and strategies."

        {
            question: "How can I get in touch with the Vandelay Technologies team?",
            answer: "The best way to connect is by joining our Telegram group via the Vandelay Auth Portal. It's a casual space where our team and community discuss everything from tokenomics to memes to market alpha. We also share updates, answer questions, and welcome collaboration. You can also explore our builds on GitHub to see what we're working on."
        },
        {
            question: "Does Vandelay Technologies build its own Web3 projects, or only work with clients?",
            answer: "We do both. Vandelay Technologies actively launches its own projects - ranging from profit-generating dApps to experimental, passion-driven ideas that push the space forward. We collaborate with open-source contributors, degens, and Web3-curious creatives. If you're a builder, strategist, or just want to contribute to something innovative, we encourage you to reach out via Telegram and get involved."
        },
        {
            question: "Can Vandelay Technologies help with smart contract audits and security best practices?",
            answer: "Yes. We write secure, gas-efficient contracts following industry standards, and collaborate with trusted audit partners when needed. From anti-sniping protections to DAO governance mechanisms, our builds prioritize security from day one. You can review sample contracts and public builds on our GitHub repository."
        },
        {
            question: "What ecosystems and chains does Vandelay Technologies support?",
            answer: "We're chain-agnostic and experienced across Ethereum mainnet, Layer 2s (Arbitrum, Optimism, Base, Polygon), and EVM-compatible chains (BNB Chain, Avalanche, etc.). We tailor our stack to your goals - whether it's low-gas NFT minting, DeFi protocol deployment, or launching a fair memecoin with built-in anti-bot logic."
